Hey Andre,
This is a quick note for you so you don't have to read the giant README from the original guy who wrote this. 
**Before you do anything, run "source requirements.txt".**
This is a small script I wrote that pip installs all the propper librarys to run the code. These were the biggest problems for me, 
so if you run into any issues its probably a library problem. 
Just so you know Im running python3.9, not that that should matter



There are only two folders in this repository that you will ever have to worry about. pbasemap and peru. 

/pbasemap is where all of the code is stored. In order to start running commands from this repo you will do "cd pbasemap" and then "python pbasemap.py -h"(help command, shows what everthing can do)
/peru I made. It contains all of the mosaics metadata, and a geojson object of the country. These combined will download everything since 2015ish to now from Peru.


Now, you are ready to begin downloading. Since I already set up the .csv's with the mosaica_list command, all you need to do is cd into /pbasemap and run the following command
python pbasemap.py download --geometry ../peru/peru.geojson --local ../peru/peru_data --idlist ../peru/peru.csv
